 Requirements:
 - Maintain one structure to store contact info.
 - Make sure that , duplicate contacts should not be there.
 
 DELIVERABLES:
 1. This app should contain user-defined functions for each and every task.
 2. Use makefile and make tool to manage the project.
 3. Use readme.txt to explain the usage of the project, how to compile, execute etc..
 4. If we re-launch  the app , old / previows data should be available.
 5. Deliver the project, in a folder(named your ID), containing all source files, headerfiles, makefile, and readme.txt.
 
 PROJECT approach :
 1. By using Singly Linked List , complete the project.
 2. FileHandling : File based functions like save(), syncfile(),  should use to store data in file.
 3. For every function , separate file should be implemented.
 
 SUGGESTION:\
 A)Use typedef, enum, union where-ever applicable.\
 B) Use separate header file to keep all structure, union , and typedefs.
